{"name":"Frogjump","tagline":"Remote control for Google Maps for Android","body":"# Frogjump #\r\n\r\n**Frogjump** is a remote control program for [Google Maps for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps).\r\n\r\nThis allows (mostly) hands-free remote control of Google Maps for Android navigation, so that a driver can use their mobile phone with Google Maps while the passengers set the destination.\r\n\r\nThere is also support for [_as the crow flies_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies) navigation with [GPS Status and Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2).\r\n\r\nTo start navigation, you must click a Google Maps or `geo:` link.  Only Google Maps links in Five Eyes countries are supported right now.\r\n\r\n[Get it on the Google Play Store!](https://play.google.com/)\r\n\r\n## Supports ##\r\n\r\n* `geo:` links\r\n* Google Maps links in Five Eyes countries\r\n* Google Maps navigation by car, bike, foot, and avoiding toll roads.\r\n* GPS Status and Toolbox \"radar\" navigation\r\n\r\n## Caveats ##\r\n\r\n* Does not hook the \"share\" function inside Google Maps itself, because this doesn't use `geo:` URLs.\r\n* It isn't possible to see recent messages sent to the group.\r\n* It isn't possible to see who is in the group.\r\n* Only supports Google Maps. Other apps can be implemented where they have similar hands-free intents.\r\n* If navigation is in progress, Google Maps needs confirmation to change destination.\r\n* GCM registration is fragile.  Rotate your device to retry the connection.\r\n* The UI is ugly.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
